## Overview

This repository documents a novel **Sulfur-Fueled Closed-Loop Thermal Power System**, designed to generate clean, continuous energy from elemental sulfur with near-zero emissions through a fully circular combustion and recycling cycle.

The system leverages sealed combustion of sulfur, heat conversion via thermophotovoltaic (TPV) modules or closed Brayton-cycle turbines, and catalytic SO₂ capture and recycling to elemental sulfur or sulfuric acid.

## Key Features

- **Closed-loop combustion:** No sulfur emissions; recycling over 95%.  
- **Modular scale:** From 3 kW household units to >1 MW industrial plants.  
- **Clean energy:** Zero CO₂ emissions if renewable oxygen is used.  
- **High efficiency:** Up to ~45% thermal-to-electric conversion.  
- **Thermal storage:** Integrated ceramic or molten salt reservoirs for stable output.  
- **Applications:** Off-grid power, industrial scale energy, and space habitats.

## Technical Summary

- Sulfur combusted in sealed chamber with pure oxygen/enriched air.  
- Heat converted by TPV cells or closed Brayton-cycle turbines.  
- SO₂ emissions captured via catalytic Claus process; recycled to sulfur or sulfuric acid.  
- Heat storage buffers load fluctuations; supports battery hybridization.  
- Safety ensured through sealed combustion, oxygen sensors, and corrosion-resistant materials.

## Why This Matters

- Converts abundant, low-cost sulfur waste into valuable energy.  
- Eliminates acid rain and sulfur emissions from traditional sulfur combustion.  
- Enables sustainable power in sulfur-rich or remote regions.  
- Potential breakthrough for space colonization power systems.
